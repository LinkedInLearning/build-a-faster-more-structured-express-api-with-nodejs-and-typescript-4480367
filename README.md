JavaScript is not going anywhere, but TypeScript is being used more and more in larger, production level projects. Being able to understand and use TypeScript in a backend environment will be useful for those who are interested in upgrading their largest JavaScript projects. In this course, software engineer Dakota Fabro teaches you how to: configure a project for TypeScript; configure a database connection for use with the API; build a seed file for the development process; build an Express server utilizing TypeScript; use Jest to test your API endpoints; host your API as a web service using Render; and write a proper README to explain and describe API routes for frontend developers.

_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._
## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
