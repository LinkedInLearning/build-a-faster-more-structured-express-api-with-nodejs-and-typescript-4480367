Types in Express Functions:
- Define the type only when returning an object in the function

MongoDB:
- Mongo URI: create a "dummy" user and password for the URI (Do not use your own password and information)
  - Under "Database Access" and a new user:
    - user: testuser1
    - pw: test
- no need to install @types/mongoose (comes with its own types)
- Under "Network Access": Be sure to set IP address to "Allow access from anywhere" (0.0.0.0/0)

Render:
- Set NODE_VERSION environment variable
- root directory is ./build because this is compiled to JS
- build script should be "npm install && tsc" in package.json
- build script in Render should be "npm ci; npm run build"
- start script in Render is yarn start
